    "# Why is graph design important?\n",
    "<p>For data scientists, the creation of effective graphics and visualizations is crucial to presenting one's analysis and potential insights. The use of graphical tools allows us to simplify our work by removing unneccessary complexity; this leads to easier interpretation and a greater focus on key points.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>When creating a data product that will be used regularly (dashboards, interactive graphs, etc.), it is crucial to incorporate strong visuals as this will enhance user experience and the overall efficiency of the tool. Robust data graphics enable for less time to be spent on interpretation, which frees up time for further analysis or questioning on behalf of the user / audience.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p> Without the use of well-made graphics, we run the risk of misrepresenting central parts of our analysis. On one end, a poorly made graph may just bore our audience; a graph or chart that is quickly seen and forgotten after the presentation's conclusion. On the other hand, a poorly made visual has the potential to mislead your audience or misconstrue your analysis. Both of these outcomes are suboptimal and should always be avoided.\n",
